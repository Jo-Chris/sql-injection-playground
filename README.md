# SQL-Injection-Playground

Due to a small university project we created a little sql injection playground.

1. Create/Import a Database called `sqlinjection` or import the one provided unter `/example`

2. Add the table and column to be queried in `config/config.php` - An example is provided.

3. The form will now query the database table with wildcards on both ends. 

4. Feel free to try some basic sql injection code! If you need an example, the `example` folder holds an example database with some querys exposing the database. 
Just import it into MySQL or phpmyadmin and inject it. :fire:

Happy Hacking!
